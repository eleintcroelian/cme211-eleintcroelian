README File for CME211 Midterm - Mert Can Simsek

Since we have a time limit for this assignment, I chose procedural approach for the ease of
debugging, and also I haven't spent enough time with object oriented approach to feel more
comfortable with it. The midterm does not ask for error handling but I could add error handling
if I had more time to work on it.

Finding and dropping the lowest grade function uses min() and index() functions for each student.
I'd assume both functions are linear search functions so I'd expect them to have O(n) complexity.
The function find_lowest() in the code also contains compute_assignment_scores() which is again O(n)
complexity. Since none of these functions are nested, I'd estimate the overall complexity O(3n).

I've hand calculated the given example grades for 2 students and got the same results with the code.
Also added another test file which is again easy to hand calculate to see if I got the same results,
which I did.
