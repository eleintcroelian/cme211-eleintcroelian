README file for CME211 - Homework 2 by Mert Can Simsek

Part 1


1- I tried to create a data set with two similar movies and 
a third movie not similar with either two. Total number of
movies was 3 and total users were 10 with total of 30 ratings.

2- The data file provided is not sorted, and one of the
considerations was to have a set not sorted. I tried to
have a few users rating only 5 and 1 as mentioned in the 
homework instructions. There were 4 columns seperated with
a tab, same as in the data file.

3- After I got the output from the similarity.py for the test
data, I hand calculated the similarities for the movies by
hand to check if they matched, which they did. I did the
calculations in a short MATLAB code which was hard coded
for the test data, unlike similarity.py.


Part 2


Command line log:

$ python3 similarity.py u.data output.txt
Input MovieLens file: u.data
Output file for similarity data: output.txt
Minimum number of common users: 5
Read 100000 lines with total of 1682 movies and 943 users
Computed similarities in 40.203 seconds


There are three functions in similarity.py. One of them 
calculates the adjusted cosine similarity for two movies.
This function is the mostly used function in the code,
and is called for every movie comparison. The other two
functions are for creating dictionaries from the data file.
One creates dictionaries with a key as an integer and a list
as a value, taking inputs for which column to be a key or a
value. Other one has a different format in which the key is
a tuple and the value is an integer. These functions are
called in the beginning of the code, saving a lot of lines.
